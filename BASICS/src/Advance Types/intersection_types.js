// when more than one type of nature can be applied to an identifier
var numT; // ! Well logically this doesn't make sense
var textBox = {
    // todo : Now, here we MUST implement the functions of the types inherited basically
    drag: function () { }, // * remember comma 
    resize: function () { }
};
